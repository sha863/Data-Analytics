 ## 01. Profitable_apps_Profiles_for_the_App_store_and_Google_Play_Markets

Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.

## 04. Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes

In this project, we're going to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Our goal is to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% — so we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).

To train the algorithm, we'll use a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the The UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data collection process is described in more details on this page, where you can also find some of the papers authored by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo.


## 05. Clean_and_analyze_Employee_Exit_Survey

In this project, we'll clean and analyze exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)}) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia. The TAFE exit survey can be found here and the survey for the DETE can be found here.

We'll pretend our stakeholders want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer the following question:

Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?


## 06. Exploring_Ebay_Car_Sales_Data

We will be working on a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. The version of the dataset we are working with is a sample of 50,000 data points that was prepared by Dataquest including simulating a less-cleaned version of the data.

The data dictionary provided with data is as follows:

- dateCrawled - When this ad was first crawled. All field-values are taken from this date.
- name - Name of the car.
- seller - Whether the seller is private or a dealer.
- offerType - The type of listing
- price - The price on the ad to sell the car.
- abtest - Whether the listing is included in an A/B test.
- vehicleType - The vehicle Type.
- yearOfRegistration - The year in which which year the car was first registered.
- gearbox - The transmission type.
- powerPS - The power of the car in PS.
- model - The car model name.
- kilometer - How many kilometers the car has driven.
- monthOfRegistration - The month in which which year the car was first registered.
- fuelType - What type of fuel the car uses.
- brand - The brand of the car.
- notRepairedDamage - If the car has a damage which is not yet repaired.
- dateCreated - The date on which the eBay listing was created.
- nrOfPictures - The number of pictures in the ad.
- postalCode - The postal code for the location of the vehicle.
- lastSeenOnline - When the crawler saw this ad last online.

The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.

## 07. Finding_the_Best_Markets_to_advertise_in.

we're working for an an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. Our goal in this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in.

We can try to search existing data that might be relevant for our purpose. One good candidate is the data from freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey. freeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run a popular Medium publication (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis.


## 08. Hacker news data analysis


- Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

- You can find the data set here, but note that it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. Below are descriptions of the columns:

  - id: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post
  - title: The title of the post
  - url: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL
  - num_points: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes
  - num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the post
  - author: The username of the person who submitted the post
  - created_at: The date and time at which the post was submitted

## 09. Investigating_Fandango_Movie_Ratings


In October 2015, Walt Hickey from FiveThirtyEight published a popular article where he presented strong evidence which suggest that Fandango's movie rating system was biased and dishonest.

In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.


## 10. Mobile_App_for_Lottery_Addiction

In this project, we are going to contribute to the development of a mobile app by writing a couple of functions that are mostly focused on calculating probabilities. The app is aimed to both prevent and treat lottery addiction by helping people better estimate their chances of winning.

The app idea comes from a medical institute which is specialized in treating gambling addictions. The institute already has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that can answer users the following questions:

- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three) winning numbers on a single ticket? The scenario we're following throughout this project is fictional — the main purpose is to practice applying probability and combinatorics (permutations and combinations) concepts in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario.
